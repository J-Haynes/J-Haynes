Below are a collection of group and solo work I completed during both duringmy time at Dev Academmy and in my free time: 

[PingPong](https://github.com/J-Haynes/pingpong)- This was my final group project at Dev Academy. Built in React Native, it is a basic social media app designed to kill your groupchat. Sign up, add your friends, and send a 'ping' with your current location to let your friends know what you're up to!

[Weather](https://github.com/J-Haynes/weather-app) - A simple full stack weather app built in react.js.
